# Accelerators/GPUs

- Specialized parallel hardware for compute-intensive operations
    - Co-processors for traditional CPUs
    - Based on highly parallel architectures
    - Graphics processing units (GPU) have been the most common
      accelerators during the last few years
- Promises
    - Very high performance per node
    - More FLOPS/Watt
- Usually major rewrites of programs required

# Challenges in Using Accelerators/GPUs

**Applicability**: Is your algorithm suitable for GPU?

**Programmability**: Is the programming effort acceptable?

**Portability**: Rapidly evolving ecosystem and incompatibilities between vendors.

**Availability**: Can you access a (large scale) system with GPUs?

**Scalability**: Can you scale the GPU software efficiently to several nodes?

#  Accelerator/GPU Programming Model

- GPUs are co-processors to the CPU
- CPU controls the work flow:
  - *offloads* computations to GPU by launching *kernels*
  - allocates and deallocates the memory on GPUs
  - handles the data transfers between CPU and GPUs
- CPU and GPU can work concurrently
   - kernel launches are normally asynchronous


# Using GPUs

<div class="column">

1. Use existing GPU applications
2. Use accelerated libraries
3. Features in language standards
    - C++ `stdpar`, Fortran `DO CONCURRENT`
4. Directive based methods
    - **OpenMP**, OpenACC
5. High-level GPU programming
    - **Kokkos**, **SYCL**, Alpaka, RAJA, ...
6. Use direct GPU programming
    - CUDA, HIP, ...
